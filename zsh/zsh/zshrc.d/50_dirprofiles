# directory based profiles (from grml)

function chpwd_profiles() {
    # Say you want certain settings to be active in certain directories.
    # This is what you want.
    #
    # zstyle ':chpwd:profiles:/usr/src/grml(|/|/*)'   profile grml
    # zstyle ':chpwd:profiles:/usr/src/debian(|/|/*)' profile debian
    #
    # When that's done and you enter a directory that matches the pattern
    # in the third part of the context, a function called chpwd_profile_grml,
    # for example, is called (if it exists).
    #
    # If no pattern matches (read: no profile is detected) the profile is
    # set to 'default', which means chpwd_profile_default is attempted to
    # be called.
    #
    # A word about the context (the ':chpwd:profiles:*' stuff in the zstyle
    # command) which is used: The third part in the context is matched against
    # ${PWD}. That's why using a pattern such as /foo/bar(|/|/*) makes sense.
    # Because that way the profile is detected for all these values of ${PWD}:
    #   /foo/bar
    #   /foo/bar/
    #   /foo/bar/baz
    # So, if you want to make double damn sure a profile works in /foo/bar
    # and everywhere deeper in that tree, just use (|/|/*) and be happy.
    #
    # The name of the detected profile will be available in a variable called
    # 'profile' in your functions. You don't need to do anything, it'll just
    # be there.
    #
    # Then there is the parameter $CHPWD_PROFILE is set to the profile, that
    # was is currently active. That way you can avoid running code for a
    # profile that is already active, by running code such as the following
    # at the start of your function:
    #
    # function chpwd_profile_grml() {
    #     [[ ${profile} == ${CHPWD_PROFILE} ]] && return 1
    #   ...
    # }
    #
    # The initial value for $CHPWD_PROFILE is 'default'.
    #
    # Version requirement:
    #   This feature requires zsh 4.3.3 or newer.
    #   If you use this feature and need to know whether it is active in your
    #   current shell, there are several ways to do that. Here are two simple
    #   ways:
    #
    #   a) If knowing if the profiles feature is active when zsh starts is
    #      good enough for you, you can put the following snippet into your
    #      .zshrc.local:
    #
    #   (( ${+functions[chpwd_profiles]} )) && print "directory profiles active"
    #
    #   b) If that is not good enough, and you would prefer to be notified
    #      whenever a profile changes, you can solve that by making sure you
    #      start *every* profile function you create like this:
    #
    #   function chpwd_profile_myprofilename() {
    #       [[ ${profile} == ${CHPWD_PROFILE} ]] && return 1
    #       print "chpwd(): Switching to profile: $profile"
    #     ...
    #   }
    #
    #      That makes sure you only get notified if a profile is *changed*,
    #      not everytime you change directory, which would probably piss
    #      you off fairly quickly. :-)
    #
    # There you go. Now have fun with that.
