*tSkeleton.txt*              tSkeleton -- File Templates and Code Skeletons

Author: Thomas Link, micathom AT gmail com?subject=vim

tSkeleton provides file templates and code skeletons (snippets). These 
templates may contain special tags that are replaced with some computed 
value (e.g., variables, user input ...), vimscript code, or place 
holders/jump positions (see |tSkeleton-jump-positions|).


-----------------------------------------------------------------------
                                                    *tSkeleton-install*
Install~

Edit the vba file and type:

    :so %

See :help vimball for details. If you use vim 7.0, you probably need to 
update vimball first.

If you don't already have some skeletons, you may want to download 
tSkeleton-Samples.zip from:

    http://www.vim.org/scripts/script.php?script_id=1160

Extract zip (or copy the contained files) to your local vimfiles 
directory (see also |add-global-plugin|). The directory structure should 
look like this:

    ~/.vim/skeletons/
        FILE TEMPLATES ...
        map/
            MAP FILES FOR CONDITIONAL EXPANSION
        bits/
            &filetype.txt (single line templates)
            general/
                GENERAL CODE SKELETONS ...
            &filetype/
                FILETYPE SPECIFIC CODE SKELETONS: ONE SKELETON PER FILE ...

                                                    *g:tskelDir*
If you re-use skeletons from version 1.0 with a later version, you have 
to update the |tSkeleton-place-holder| markup. Make sure the variable 
g:tskelDir points to the right directory.

You might want to use imaps.vim's (vimscript #244 or vimscript #475) place 
holders in conjunction with template bits.

If you don't use imaps.vim, you can use |TSkeletonMapGoToNextTag()|.

                                                    *tSkeleton-usage*
File templates~

The file skeletons are stored in the skeletons subdirectory. Which 
template is used for which new file is controlled by |:autocmd|s. This 
provides greater flexibility than a &filetype based approach as you can 
select templates on the basis of a filename pattern or a specific 
directory.

Currently, the following file types are supported by default:

   - batch.bat
   - deplate.txt
   - latex.tex
   - php.inc.php
   - php.php
   - plugin.vim
   - ruby.rb
   - shell.sh
   - text.txt

In order to add support for a new filetype, save a skeleton file to 
~/.vim/skeletons/file.suffix and add something like this to your .vimrc 
file: >

    autocmd BufNewFile *.suffix       TSkeletonSetup template.suffix
    autocmd BufNewFile /here/*.suffix TSkeletonSetup othertemplate.suffix


Alternatively, you can store templates as:
    ~/vimfiles/skeletons/templates/GROUP/FILETYPE PATTERN

The pattern is an encoded pattern (# == *, %XX=Char XXh) for 
auto-generated autocmds.


                                                    *tSkeleton-place-holder*

Tags (which look like <+...+>) serve two purposes:
    - marker for jump positions
    - dynamic content expansion

You can use tags to define cursor jump positions. tSkeleton also 
supports some special tags that are expanded when inserting the 
skeleton.

A list of special tags:
                                                    *tSkeletion-<+FILE NAME ROOT+>*
    <+FILE NAME ROOT+>
        The file name root
                                                    *tSkeletion-<+FILE NAME+>*
    <+FILE NAME+>
        The file name
                                                    *tSkeletion-<+FILE SUFFIX+>*
    <+FILE SUFFIX+>
        The file suffix
                                                    *tSkeletion-<+FILE DIRNAME+>*
    <+FILE DIRNAME+>
        The file's directory
                                                    *tSkeletion-<+NOTE+>*
    <+NOTE+>
        A note
                                                    *tSkeletion-<+DATE+>*
    <+DATE+>
        The current date (the format is controlled via 
        g:tskelDateFormat)
                                                    *tSkeletion-<+AUTHOR+>*
    <+AUTHOR+>
        The author's name (g:tskelUserName)
                                                    *tSkeletion-<+EMAIL+>*
    <+EMAIL+>
        The author's e-mail (g:tskelUserEmail)
                                                    *tSkeletion-<+WEBSITE+>*
    <+WEBSITE+>
        The author's homepage (g:tskelUserWWW)
                                                    *tSkeletion-<+LICENSE+>*
    <+LICENSE+>
        The name of the license this file is released under 
        (g:tskelLicense)

In order to define your own tag, you have to define a function called 
TSkeleton_TAGNAME() that returns the text to be filled in.

                                                    *tSkeleton-tags*
tSkeleton also supports the following pseudo-tags:

    <+CURSOR+>                                      *tSkeletion-<+CURSOR+>*
        Where to place the cursor after insertion

    <+&NAME+>                                       *tSkeletion-<+&+>*
        A vim option

    <+g:NAME+>                                      *tSkeletion-<+g:+>*
        A global variable

    <+b:NAME+>                                      *tSkeletion-<+b:+>*
        A buffer local variable
 
    <+?QUERY?+>                                     *tSkeletion-<+?+>*
        Query[1] the user

    <+?VAR|QUERY?+>
        Query[1] the user and propose some choices from the variable VAR

                                                    *tSkeletion-<+bit+>*
    <+bit:BIT+>, <+bit:BIT|"DEFAULT"+>, <+bit:BIT|COMMANDS+>
        Insert a bit; if the bit isn't defined for the current filetype, 
        use DEFAULT; if DEFAULT matches ".*" insert it as a string; 
        otherwise interpret it as a command sequence to be fed to normal

    <+tskel:TSKELETON+>                             *tSkeletion-<+tskel+>*
        Same as the above

    <+call:FUNCTION(ARGS)+>                         *tSkeletion-<+call+>*
        Insert the result value of some function

    <+include(TSKELETON)+>                           *tSkeletion-<+include+>*
        Another synonym for the above.

    <+execute(EX COMMAND)+>                         *tSkeletion-<+execute+>*
        Run a vim command.

[1] If the query ends with a colon, the second question mark will be 
removed. Up to verson 2.4 VAR is a string, separating the items by an 
"\n". From 3.0 on, VAR is a list.

NOTE: Flow control and loop tags are experimental and it's more than 
just likely that the output doesn't meet your expectations.

Flow control:                                       *tSkeletion-<+if+>*
    <+if(CONDITION)+>
    <+elseif(CONDITION)+>
    <+else+>
    <+endif+>

Loops:                                              *tSkeletion-<+for+>*
    <+for(VAR in LIST)+>
    <+endfor+>, <+endfor(VAR)+>
        If you nest for loops, you have to add the variable name to the 
        endfor tag. And no, this isn't the most clever way to do this.

Variables:                                          *tSkeletion-<+let+>*
    <+let(VAR=VALUE)+>
        The variable will be unset or restored to its original value 
        after processing the current template.
        VAR may have some modifiers attached:
            VAR? ... Set only if undefined
            VAR& ... Don't restore original variable

Interaction:                                        *tSkeletion-<+input+>*
    <+input(VAR, QUERY, [DEFAULT], [COMPLETION])+>
        This will insert the user input and set the variable VAR (unless 
        empty), which can be used throughout the template. The variable 
        will be removed after finishing the current template. If the 
        variable was previously defined, the original value will be 
        restored.
        If VAR ends with '!', no text will be inserted in the buffer. In 
        this case any whitespace (including one newline) after the tag 
        will be removed. See also the notes on |tSkeletion-<+input+>|.

    <+select(VAR, LIST)+>
        Let the user select an item from a list.
        VAR is a string.
        Example: >
            before(<+select("s:type", [":all", ":each"])+>)
< 

Other:                                              *tSkeletion-<+nl+>*
    <+nl+>
        Insert a newline
                
    <+joinline+>                                    *tSkeletion-<+joinline+>*
        Join with next line. Delete any whitespace.
            
    <+nop+>                                         *tSkeletion-<+nop+>*
        Insert nothing (could be necessary in conjunction with the "for" 
        tag)

A wiki like table could then be constructed using a skeleton like this: >

    <tskel:before>
    let s:my_rows = input('Rows: ')
    let s:my_cols = input('Columns: ')
    </tskel:before>
    <tskel:after>
    unlet! s:my_rows s:my_cols
    </tskel:after>
    <+CURSOR+><+for(i in range(s:my_rows))+>
    |<+for(j in range(s:my_cols))+> <+CELL+> |<+endfor(j)+><+nop+>
    <+endfor(i)+>

or: >

    <+input('s:my_rows?!', 'Rows: ')+>
    <+input('s:my_cols?!', 'Cols: ')+>
    <+for(i in range(s:my_rows))+>
    |<+for(j in range(s:my_cols))+> <+CURSOR+> |<+endfor(j)+><+nop+>
    <+endfor(i)+>

NOTE: The <+nop+> is necessary in order to prevent the <+endfor+> tag to 
"eat" the newline. If we include this bit from another bit that already 
sets s:my_rows and/or s:my_cols, the user won't be queried again (because of 
the "?" in the input statement). E.g. >

    <+let(s:my_rows = 3)+>
    <+let(s:my_cols = 3)+>
    <+include(table)+>

                                                    *tSkeletion-backslash*
Any special tag can be preceded with a backslash in order to prevent 
expansion. Examples: >

    <+\if(foo=1)+>
    
surprisingly expands to >

    <+if(foo=1)+>

It's best to use global variables with "if" and "for" tags as the body 
is most likely evaluated in a different buffer in a hypothetically 
unknown context.


                                                    *tSkeleton-jump-positions*
Unknown tags are kept in the expanded skeleton. These tags can be used 
as cursor jump marks. This syntax was originally used by imap (vimscript 
#244 or vimscript #475). If you don't want to install imap, you can also  
use |TSkeletonMapGoToNextTag()|.

Nameless tags (<++>) will disappear when they are selected.

Example:>

    case <+CURSOR+> in
    <+PATTERN+>)
        <+BODY+>
        ;;
    *)
        <+DEFAULT+>
        ;;
    esac
    <++>

When you insert this skeleton, the cursor will be placed at 
"<+CURSOR+>".  If you press <c-j>, the cursor will jump to "<+PATTERN+>" 
(the tag will remain selected). If you press <c-j> three times, the 
cursor will jump to "<++>" (the tag will be deleted).

Check out the "test_tSkeleton" skeleton for examples.


                                                    *tSkeleton-modifiers*
Tags can be modified using modifiers, like in: >

    <+TAG NAME:MODIFIER+>

Known modifiers:

    l          :: lower case
    u          :: upper case
    c          :: capitalize
    C          :: transform to CamelCase
    s/FROM/TO/ :: replace text (actually a s//g); this has to be the 
                  last modifier; the pattern separator can be selected 
                  arbitrarily

Example for a ruby class template: >

    class <+FILE NAME ROOT:cs*\W*_*+>
        <+CURSOR+>
    end
    <++>

-----------------------------------------------------------------------
                                                    *tSkeleton-code-skeletons*
                                                    *tSkeleton-bits*
Bits/Code Skeletons~

Smaller skeleton bits are stored in SKELETONS/bits/FILETYPE/ or 
SKELETONS/bits/general/. I.e., code skeletons can be filetype specific 
or generally available.

The filenames of the bits may be grouped in submenus as in:

    ../tex/&Define.%5Cnew&command
    ../tex/&Define.%5Cnew&environment

This will create skeletons for \newcommand and \newenvironment but will 
group the skeletons under the TSkel.Define. menu with the respective 
accelerators.

                                                    *tSkeleton-Types* *g:tskelTypes*
                                                    *tskeleton#Initialize()*
tSkeleton supports several types of code templates:

    - skeleton (standard tSkeleton functionality)
    - abbreviations (VIM abbreviations)
    - functions (VIM script functions extracted from :function)
    - mini ("mini" bits, one-liners etc.)
    - tags (tags-based code templates, requires ctags, I presume)

Not all types are enabled by default. User have to select, which types 
they want to use, by setting the g:tskelTypes at start-up. When changing 
the variable, users might have to call tskeleton#Initialize().

                                                    *tSkeleton-Skeleton*
Smaller skeleton bits are stored in SKELETONS/bits/FILETYPE/ or 
SKELETONS/bits/general/. I.e., code skeletons can be filetype specific 
or generally available.

Skeleton bits can be filled in by typing: >

    :TSkeletonBit NAME

For this command, command line completion is implemented. Calling this 
command will insert the contents of the respective file below the 
current line.

NOTE: Bit names should not contain ampersand (as these are interpreted 
as menu accelerators) and periods (which are used to construct 
submenus). Other special characters can be included by encoding them in 
hex form as %XX as it is done in URLs.  Example: "%5Csection" becomes 
"\section".

                                                    *tSkeleton-key-bindings*
The default key bindings for inserting code skeletons are:

    <Leader>## ... Expand name under cursor
    <Leader>#t ... Insert code skeleton via command line
    <c-\><c-\> ... In insert mode, expand the bit before the cursor (on 
                   a German keyboard this happens to be <c-#><c-#>)

                                                    *g:tskelKeyword_{&filetype}*
A bit name usually is the |word| under the cursor. If this doesn't fit 
your needs, you can define g:tskelKeyword_{&filetype} to define what 
makes up a skeleton name. Example: >

    let g:tskelKeyword_viki = '\(#\|{\)\?[^#{[:blank:]]\{-}'


                                                    *tSkeleton-embedded-code*
Code skeletons may contain vim code that is evaluated before or after 
expanding the tags. The before/after blocks are fed to |:exec| and must 
not contain function definitions.

NOTE: The "parser" is quite primitive. These tags have to start as 
single statement in a line at column 1, and they have to appear in the 
following order:

    <tskel:msg>                                     *<tskel:msg>*
        Display an explanatory message after template expansion

    <tskel:before>                                  *<tskel:before>*
        Execute code before template expansion in the target buffer

    <tskel:after>                                   *<tskel:after>*
        Execute code after template expansion in the target buffer

    <tskel:here_before>                             *<tskel:here_before>*
        Execute code before template expansion in the template buffer

    <tskel:here_after>                              *<tskel:here_after>*
        Execute code after template expansion in the template buffer

    <tskel:abbrev>                                  *<tskel:abbrev>*
        Make the bit available via |:abbreviate| under the enclosed name.

    <tskel:menu>                                    *<tskel:menu>*
        Use this menu name instead of the default one.

    <tskel:condition>                               *<tskel:condition>*
        An expression that checks whether a bit is eligible in the 
        current context.

BibTeX example: >

    <tskel:msg>
        Insert a collection entry
    </tskel:msg>
    <tskel:before>
        let b:tskelArticleID = input("ID of bibentry: ")
        if b:tskelArticleID == "" | let b:tskelArticleID = "<+CURSOR+>" | endif
    </tskel:before>
    <tskel:after>
        unlet b:tskelArticleID
    </tskel:after>
    @INCOLLECTION{<+b:tskelArticleID+>,
        author   = {<+CURSOR+>},
        title    = {<+ARTICLE TITLE+>},
        crossref = {<+CROSSREF+>},
        pages    = {<+PAGES+>},
        abstract = {[[~/Docs/Abstracts/<+b:tskelArticleID+>.txt]]},
    }
    <++>

In the above example, we query the user for an ID and insert this ID as 
entry key and as an abstract's file name.

The before/after blocks are evaluated in the destination buffer. The 
variants here_before/here_after are evaluated in the scratch buffer for 
the current code skeleton.

                                                    *tSkeleton-groups*
                                                    *g:tskelBitGroup_{&filetype}*
Groups~

Some filetype's bits might be of use for other filetypes too. You can 
make them accessible by defining a g:tskelBitGroup_{&filetype} variable. 
E.g., in php mode all html bits are made accessible by setting this 
variable (the default): >

    let g:tskelBitGroup_php = ['php', 'html']

Bits of type "general" are always available.

                                                    *tSkeleton-context*
                                                    *tSkeleton-map*
Maps -- Context-sensitive expansion~

To some extent, tSkeleton is capable of offering the user only a small 
selection of eligible bits for a specific context if a map file 
($VIMFILES/skeletons/map/{&filetype}) is provided. Such a map file is made up 
of regular expressions matching a specific context (before the cursor 
only) and a blank-separated list of eligible bits. The regexp and the 
list are separated by whitespace: >

    REGEXP  BIT1 BIT2 ... BITn

Example: >

    <form\\([^>]\\|\\n\\)*	name= action= method=

If an eligible bit is undefined, the name is inserted as is. I.e. you 
don't have to define skeletons for all these options and argument names.


                                                    *tSkeleton-minibits*
Minibits~

Mini bits are kept in the files:

    - $CWD/.tskelmini
    - $VIMFILES/skeletons/bits/{&filetype}.txt

These files contain whitespace-separated pairs of bit names and their 
expansions. These files are meant to keep expansions of accronyms and 
abbreviations and the like. Example: >

    IMHO    In my humble opinion
    AFAIK   As far as I know

                                                    *tSkeleton-menu*
                                                    *g:tskelMenuPrefix*
Menu~

If g:tskelMenuPrefix is non-empty, tSkeleton will display a menu 
containing all eligible bits for a certain filetype.

The menu can be hierarchical and certain entries may have shortcuts by 
properly naming the bits. Example: >

    &Environment.&Quote
    &Environment.Q&uotation

This will create the submenu "Environment" that can be selected by 
typing "e" (on Windows) and two entries, the first of which can be 
selected by typing "q" and the second by typing "u".

Be aware that the actual bit names are Quote and Quotation (i.e. the 
submenu and the ampersand are stripped off).


                                                    *g:tskelMapComplete*
Insert-mode completion~

If g:tskelMapComplete is true, 'completefunc' is set to 
TSkeleton_complete so that the user will be presented with a selection 
of elegible skeletons when pressing |i_CTRL-X_CTRL-U|.

                                                    *tskeleton#IncreaseRevisionNumber()*
The function tskeleton#IncreaseRevisionNumber() provides a way to 
automatically update a revision number in the form >

    @Revision: 1.0.309

In order to use this function, add something like this to your |vimrc| 
file: >

    autocmd BufWritePre * call tskeleton#IncreaseRevisionNumber()

                                                    *:TSkeletonCleanUpBibEntry*
The TSkeletonCleanUpBibEntry command can be used to purge the current bibtex 
entry from expendable fields (i.e., lines matching <+.\{-}+>).

For bibtex files, this command is bound to: <Leader>tc

                                                    *TSkeletonMapGoToNextTag()*
                                                    *tskeleton#GoToNextTag()*
If you don't want to install imaps.vim, this function will map <c-j> to 
tskeleton#GoToNextTag() in order to easily jump between tags.

You can insert >

    call TSkeletonMapGoToNextTag()

in after/plugin/tSkeleton.vim to map tskeleton#GoToNextTag() to <c-j> 
similar to imap.vim.

This will map <c-j> to tskeleton#GoToNextTag() that makes the cursor jump 
to the next tag.

This function provides one or two extras over the version of imaps.vim. 
An explanation:

    - ###, +++, ???, !!! are used as markers too.
    - If a marker is empty (e.g. <++>), the marker will be removed (as 
      imaps.vim does).
    - If a marker matches <+NAME/DEFAULT+>, the marker will be replaced 
      with DEFAULT.
