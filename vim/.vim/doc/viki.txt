================================================================================
                                                    *viki-description*
Description~

This plugin adds wiki-like hypertext capabilities to Vim. You can use viki as 
a "minor" mode (i.e., as an add-on to any other mode) or as a full-fledged 
wiki mode. There is also an add-on plugin for "wikifying" latex documents by 
turning some latex commands into wiki names. If viki is properly configured, 
activating a reference to an image, a webpage etc. will view that resource in 
an external viewer.

From http://sourceforge.net/projects/deplate/ you can download a ruby based 
tool to convert viki markup to LaTeX, HTML, or DocBook. On its homepage 
(http://deplate.sf.net) you can read a more detailled specification of the 
markup.

MINOR WIKI MODE:
Just type |:VikiMinorMode| and all wiki names and URLs will be highlighted.  
When the cursor is over a wiki name, you can press <c-cr> to jump to (or 
create) the referred page (on a terminal use <LocalLeader>vf). Pressing 
<LocalLeader>vb brings you back to the original document. Alternatively, you 
can use <m-leftmouse> and <m-rightmouse> to jump back and forth. (NOTE: In 
minor mode, it's possible that viki words and URLs are not highlighted when 
they are included in some syntactic regions.)

FULL WIKI MODE:
In full mode, viki becomes a personal wiki 
(http://c2.com/cgi/wiki?PersonalWiki). Set 'filetype' to viki or execute 
|:VikiMode|. The full wiki mode is like the minor mode but with folding 
support, syntax highlighting (for headings, lists, tables, textstyles etc.), 
and additional key bindings (i.e., you can press <c-tab> or <s-c-tab> to move 
the cursor to the next/previous viki name).

BUT HEY, WHAT IS A WIKI ANYWAY:
Among the vast amount of possible definitions, I prefer this one, which is my 
own anyway :-): a wiki is a simple way of creating hypertexts. In its basic 
form creating a hyperlink is as easy as writing a word in CamelCase (although 
this sometimes turn out to be more annoying than useful) or by a rather 
minimalist markup -- in the case of viki, this would be [[destination]] or 
[-destination-].

You begin by creating a directory where your wiki files should go to and by 
creating a wiki index -- a master file that contains references to sub-pages. 
After a while you end up with many small, tightly interlinked files/notes.

Wikis also come with a rather subtle markup. Here is a simple comparison of 
two examples of LaTeX and viki markup so that you get the idea of what it 
looks like:

LaTeX: \section{Title}
Viki:  * Title

LaTeX: \emph{text}
Viki:  __text__

And some wikis provide tools for translating this markup to other formats 
(like viki does in the form of the "deplate" program, which can translate viki 
markup to LaTeX, HTML, and Docbook). Unfortunately, about every wiki has its 
own markup. 


================================================================================
                                                    *viki-installation*
Installation~

Edit the vba file and type: >

    :so %

See :help vimball for details. If you have difficulties or use vim 7.0, 
please make sure, you have the current version of vimball (vimscript 
#1502) installed.

This script requires tlib (vimscript #1863) to be installed.

Viki requires: >

    :set nocompatible
    :filetype plugin indent on
    :syntax on

You might also want to set 'expandtab' (local to buffer) in 
after/ftplugin/viki.vim: >

    setlocal expandtab

Viki will be automatically loaded when starting vim. In case you have vim 
already running and don't want to restart it, you can also type: >

    :runtime plugin/viki.vim

Viki doesn't set the viki filetype for you. How you set the filetype is up to 
you to decide. Basically, there are two possibilities: based on a suffix or 
based on the location. See |viki-filetype-detection|.


Customization:                                      *viki-customization*
It's probably a good idea to check the values of the following variables:

    - |g:vikiUpperCharacters| and |g:vikiLowerCharacters|; for the most 
      commonly used foreign language characters in a Western European 
      context set these variables to something like (this refers to the 
      characters allowed in simple viki names and in anchors; for East Asian 
      languages you probably prefer to use quoted viki names anyway): >

        " this is in iso-latin-1
        let g:vikiLowerCharacters = "a-zäöüßáàéèíìóòçñ"
        let g:vikiUpperCharacters = "A-ZÄÖÜ"
<
    - |g:vikiUseParentSuffix| (see also |viki-names|); I personally prefer 
      this to be ON >

        let g:vikiUseParentSuffix = 1
<
    - |vikiNameTypes| (see |viki-names|): control which type of viki names you 
      want to use (this allows you to turn off, e.g., simple viki names)

You might also need to configure some external programs (use the variables 
g:vikiOpenUrlWith_{PROTOCOL} and g:vikiOpenFileWith_{SUFFIX}) like in this 
example: >

    let g:vikiOpenUrlWith_mailto = 'thunderbird -compose %{URL}'
    let g:vikiOpenFileWith_html  = "silent !firefox %{FILE}"
    let g:vikiOpenFileWith_ANY   = "silent !start %{FILE}"

This way, if you had, e.g., pdftotext (from the xpdf distribution) installed, 
you could make viki to open references to pdf files right in VIM: >

    fun! ConvertPDF()
        if !exists("b:convertedPDF")
            exec "cd ". expand("%:p:h")
            exec "%!pdftotext ". expand("%:t") ." -"
            :%!par 72w
            cd -
            setlocal noswapfile buftype=nowrite
            let b:convertedPDF = 1
        endif
    endf
    let g:vikiOpenFileWith_pdf = 'call viki#OpenLink("%{FILE}", "", 1)|silent call ConvertPDF()'

                                                    *viki-intervikis*
Later on, you probably want to define some intervikis. A |interviki| is a 
shortcut to a different viki directory/namespace, so that you have to care 
less about page names.

There are two ways to define an interviki:

                                                    *viki#Define()*
    1. Use viki#Define(name, prefix, ?suffix="*", ?index="Index.${suffix}")

        call viki#Define('SCI', $HOME."/Projects/Sci/Ideas", ".txt")

       This command will automatically define a menu for each interviki 
       (unless g:vikiMenuPrefix is empty) and it will also define a command 
       with the name of the interviki that can be used to quickly access viki 
       files from the vim command line.

                                                    *g:viki_intervikis*
    2. Use g:viki_intervikis (a dictionary). The values can be either a list 
       (arguments for |viki#Define()|) or a string.

        let g:viki_intervikis['SCI']  = [$HOME."/Projects/Sci/Ideas", ".txt"]
        let g:viki_intervikis['PROJ'] = $HOME."/Projects"

Intervikis added to g:viki_intervikis will be defined via |viki#Define()| when 
first loading ~/vimfiles/autoload/viki.vim. I.e. you cannot use automatically 
defined commands or menus before loading the autoload file. So, if you don't 
use the menus and the interviki commands to open files from the command line, 
use the variable. Otherwise, calling |viki#Define()| from 
~/vimfiles/after/plugin/viki.vim might be the better solution (which would 
also load autoload/viki.vim on startup though).

This could then be accessed as SCI::ThisIdea, which would refer to the file 
"~/Projects/Sci/Ideas/ThisIdea.txt".

viki#Define also defines a command (:SCI in this example) that opens a wiki's 
index file (an optional 4th argument or "${g:vikiIndex}.${suffix}").

Intervikis can also be defined as patterns or functions as in the following 
example: >

    fun! GetAddress(vikiname)
        let surname = substitute(a:vikiname, '^\(\u.\{-}\)\(\u\U*\)\?$', '\1', '')
        let firstname  = substitute(a:vikiname, '^\(\u.\{-}\)\(\u\U*\)\?$', '\2', '')
        return 'https://www.example.com/cgi/search.cgi?search='. surname .','. firstname
    endf

    call viki#Define('CONTACT', '*GetAddress("%s")')
    call viki#Define('INDEX', '%/foo/%s/index.html')

CONTACT::JohnDoe would the refer to 
https://www.example.com/cgi/search.cgi?search=Dow,John and [[INDEX::bar]] 
would refer to /foo/bar/index.html

In order to use the LaTeX enabled viki variant, add this to your |vimrc| file: >

    au FileType tex let b:vikiFamily="LaTeX"

In order to automatically set |deplate| as the compiler for viki files: >

    " we want to allow deplate to execute ruby code and external helper 
    " application
    let g:deplatePrg = "deplate -x -X "
    au FileType viki compiler deplate

                                                    *viki-filetype-detection*
Some users might want to automatically set the filetype to viki depening on 
the file extension. This can be done using |:autocmd|: >

    let g:vikiNameSuffix=".viki"
    autocmd! BufRead,BufNewFile *.viki set filetype=viki

You can also use |:autocmd| to set the filetype depending on the path: >

    autocmd! BufRead,BufNewFile $HOME/MyWiki/* set filetype=viki

If the variables b:getVikiLink or b:getExtVikiLink exist, their values are 
used as _function_ names for returning the current viki name's definition. A 
viki definition is an array of the three elements name, destination, anchor 
with g:vikiDefSep as the separator.

If the variables b:editVikiPage or b:createVikiPage exist, their values are 
interpreted as _command_ names for editing readable or creating new wiki 
pages.

For a better highlighting of viki files, also check out these variables:

    - |g:vikiTypewriterFont| (see |viki-textstyles|)
    - |g:vikiHeadingFont| (see |viki-headings|)
    - |g:vikiHyperLinkColor|
    - |g:vikiInexistentColor|

                                                    *viki-indent-disable*
In order to disable the indentation plugin, define the variable g:vikiNoIndent 
and set it to whatever you want.

================================================================================
                                                    *viki-names*
Viki Names~

A viki name is either:

                                                    *viki-simple-names*
    1. Simple wiki names -- these refer to files in the same directory as the 
       current file:

        a. a word in CamelCase
            VikiName
            VikiName#anchor

            NOTE: A simple viki name may include characters from 
            |g:vikiUpperCharacters| and |g:vikiLowerCharacters|.

        b. some text between "[-" and "-]"
            [-name-]
            [-some name-]#there

            NOTE: "[--]" refers to the current file.

            NOTE: Anyways, the characters []:*&?<>/|\" are not allowed in 
            names as they usually cause trouble when included in file names.

                                                    *interviki*
         c. an "inter wiki" name, where the first part (in upper-case letters) 
         is a shortcut to some other viki, so that you have to care less about 
         page names

            OTHERVIKI::VikiName
            OTHERVIKI::VikiName#there
            OTHERVIKI::[-some name-]
            OTHERVIKI::[-some name-]#there

            E.g., if you had two intervikis defined, say SCI and COMP, you 
            could the refer to their pages as in: >

                Couldn't SCI::ThisIdeaOfMine be combined with COMP::ThisIdeaOfMine?
<
            NOTE: You can define intervikis with the VikiDefine command: >

                VikiDefine OTHERVIKI /home/t/Wiki .vik

<           Then OTHERVIKI::VikiName points to the file "/home/t/Wiki/VikiName.vik".

            NOTE: Set the string variable g:vikiInter{NAME}_suffix (see 
            |curly-braces-names|) in order to override the settings of 
            |b:vikiNameSuffix| and |g:vikiUseParentSuffix| for references to 
            the other viki.

        NOTE: If the variable |b:vikiNameSuffix| is defined, it will be added to 
        simple wiki names so that the simple wiki name "OtherFile" refers to 
        "OtherFile.suffix" -- e.g. for interlinking LaTeX-files.  
        Alternatively, you can set |g:vikiUseParentSuffix| to non-zero in order 
        to make viki always append the "parent" file's suffix to the 
        destination file.

                                                    *viki-extended-names*
    2. an extended wiki name of the form:

            [[destination]]
            [[OTHERVIKI::destination]]
            [[destination][name]]
            [[destination#anchor][name]]
            [[#anchor]]
            [[#anchor][name]]

        NOTE: The destination name is taken literally, i.e. variables like 
        |g:vikiUseParentSuffix| or |b:vikiNameSuffix| have no effect.

        NOTE: Opening extended wiki names referring to files with suffixes 
        matching one of |vikiSpecialFiles| (e.g. [[test.jpg]]) can be 
        delegated to the operating system -- see |VikiOpenSpecialFile()|. The 
        same is true for names matching |vikiSpecialProtocols|, which will be 
        opened with |VikiOpenSpecialProtocol()|.

        NOTE: In extended wiki names, destination path is relative to the 
        document's current directory if it doesn't match 
        "^\(\/\|[a-z]:\|[a-z]\+://\)". I.e.  [[../test]] refers to the 
        directory parent to the document's directory. A tilde at the beginning 
        will be replaced with $HOME.

                                                    *viki-urls*
    3. an URL
        It is assumed that these URLs should be opened with an external 
        program; this behaviour can be changed by redefining the function 
        |VikiOpenSpecialProtocol()|.

    4. Hyperwords (not supported by deplate)
        Hyperwords are defined in either ./.vikiWords or &rtp[0]/vikiWords.txt 
        each word in a line in the form "word destination" (lines beginning  
        with '%' are ignored). These words are automatically highlighted.  
        Depending on your setting of |vikiNameTypes|, viki may try to make 
        hyperwords out of the filenames in the current buffer's directory.  
        I.e. if |vikiNameSuffix| is '.txt' and there is a file 'example.txt' 
        in the same directory as the current buffer's file, then each 
        occurrence of the word 'example' will be turned into a clickable link. 
        You can prevent a file name from being highlighted as hyperword by 
        defining an entry in the vikiWords file with "-" as destination.

Adding #[a-z0-9]\+ to the wiki name denotes a reference to a specific anchor.  
Examples for wiki names referring to an anchor: >

	ThatPage#there
	[[anyplace/filename.txt#there]]
	[[anyplace/filename.txt#there][Filename]]

A anchor is marked as "^".b:commentStart."\?#[a-z0-9]\+" in the destination
file. If |b:commentStart| is not defined, the EnhancedCommentify-variables or
|&commentstring| will be used instead.  Examples ('|' = beginning of line):

    - LaTeX file, b:commentStart is set to "%"
      |%#anchor
      |#anchor
    - C file, |&commentstring| is set to "/*%s*/"
      |/*#anchor */
    - Text file, b:commentStart is undefined
      |#anchor

NOTE: If "#" is the comment character (as in ruby), a space should follow the
comment character in order to distinguish comments from anchors.

NOTE: In "full" viki mode (when invoked via VikiMode) comments are marked 
with "%" by default (see g:vikiCommentStart). An anchor has thus to be 
written as in the LaTeX example.

NOTE: |deplate| attaches an anchor to the previous element (e.g. |viki-tables|).

                                                    *viki-markup*
Pseudo Markup~

The pseudo markup is to some degree compatible with emacs-wiki, which in turn  
is to some degree compatible with some other wiki -- i.e., it's compatible 
enough to edit and work with files in emacs-wiki markup, but in some aspects 
it's more restrictive. Unfortunately, as there is currently no 
html-translator/exporter for this markup, it's quite useless for the moment.
But it looks nice on the screen.


                                                    *viki-headings*
Headings~
* Level 1
** Level 2
...

    NOTE: Headings can span more than one line by putting a backslash ('\') at 
    the end of the line.

    NOTE: If |g:vikiHeadingFont| is defined, the heading will be set in this 
    font.


                                                    *viki-lists*
Lists: (indented)~

    - Item
        * Item
            + Item
                1. Item 1
                    a. Item a
                    B. Item B
        # Item
            # Item 1
            # Item 2
                @ Item A
                @ Item B

NOTE: "@" (unordered lists) and "#" (ordered lists) are the preferred markers.


                                                    *viki-descriptions*

                                                    *viki-textstyles*
Textstyles~

    __emphasized__, ''typewriter''

<   NOTE: There must not be a whitespace after the opening mark.

    NOTE: For the word styles, there must be a non-word character (|/\W|) 
    before the opening mark, i.e. a__b__c will be highlighted as normal text -- 
    it won't be highlighted. You could use the continuous markup for putting 
    the "b" in the example in italic.

    NOTE: If |g:vikiTypewriterFont| is defined, this font will be used to 
    highlight text in typewriter style.

    NOTE: See also |g:vikiMarkupEndsWithNewline|.

It depends on the formatter if these options have any effect.
    - DOC ... document options
    - OPT ... element options (applies to the previous element)


                                                   *viki-macros*
Curly braces~
Curly braces should be escaped with a backslash (i.e., \{ and \}), as they 
usually mark macros: >

    {MACRO [OPTIONS]: ARGS...}
<
Short list of available macros (see also |deplate|):
    - {fn: ID}
        - inserts a footnote as defined by in a Fn or Footnote region. 
        - output depends on the formatter
        - Example: >
            Foo bar{fn: x} foo bar.

            #Fn: x <<EOF
                Bla bla.
            EOF
<   - {cite: ID}
        - output depends on the formatter
    - {date: [format string|now|today]}
        - the format string uses ruby's strftime method.
    - {ins: LITERALLY INSERTED TEXT}
        - Example: {ins fmt=html: &lt;&lt;}
    - {doc: ID}
        - access document options, e.g. {opt: author}
    - {opt: ID}
        - access element (paragraph, table etc.) options
    - {ruby [alt=ALTERNATIVE OUTPUT]: RUBY CODE}
        - if the evaluation of ruby code is disabled, the text given in the 
          alt option or an empty string will be inserted
        - a sequence of ruby commands must be separated by semicolons

Common options:
    - fmt=FORMATTER, nofmt=UNMATCHED FORMATTER

NOTE: Macros cannot cross paragraph borders, i.e., they must not contain empty 
lines. Using newlines in a macro argument is useless, as the macro text will 
be collapsed to one single line.


                                                    *viki-backslash*
Backslashes~
    - A backslash at the end of the line should make a pattern include the 
      next line.
    - In general, a backslash should be an escape character that prevents the 
      vikification of the following character.
    - A backslash should itself be escaped by a backslash.

\_nounderline_, \NoVikiName

Default Key Binding~

<c-cr> ... |viki#MaybeFollowLink()|: Usually only works when the cursor is over 
a wiki syntax group -- if the second argument is 1 it tries to interpret the 
text under the cursor as a wiki name anyway. (NOTE: If you're working on a 
terminal, <c-cr> most likely won't work. Use <LocalLeader>vf instead.)

<LocalLeader>vf ... Open in window
<LocalLeader>vt ... Open in a new tab
<LocalLeader>vs ... Open in a new window
<LocalLeader>vv ... Open in a new window but split vertically
    - see also |vikiSplit|

<LocalLeader>v1 - <LocalLeader>v4 ... Open in window 1-4

<LocalLeader>ve ... |:VikiEdit| edit a viki page

<LocalLeader>vb <LocalLeader>v<left> ... |viki#GoBack()|
<LocalLeader>v<bs> <LocalLeader>v<up> ... |viki#GoParent()|

<LocalLeader>vq ... |:VikiQuote| mark selected text a quoted viki name

<LocalLeader>vd ... |:VikiMarkInexistent| in the whole document
<LocalLeader>vp ... |:VikiMarkInexistent| in the current paragraph

If |g:vikiMapMouse| is true then these mappings are active, too:
<m-leftmouse> ... |viki#MaybeFollowLink()|
<m-leftmouse> ... |viki#GoBack()| (always jumps to the last known entry point)

                                                    *viki-commands*
Commands~

                                                    *:VikiMinorMode*
- VikiMinorMode
  NOTE: Be aware that we cannot highlight a reference if the text is embedded 
  in syntax group that doesn't allow inclusion of arbitrary syntax elemtents.

                                                    *:VikiMode*
- VikiMode (do additional highlighting)
  Basically the same as: >
    set ft=viki
< The main difference between these two is that VikiMode unlets 
  b:did_ftplugin to make sure that the ftplugin gets loaded.

                                                    *:VikiFind*
                                                    *:VikiFindNext* *:VikiFindPrev*
- VikiFindNext, VikiFindPrev (find the next/previous viki name or URL)

                                                    *:VikiMarkInexistent*
                                                    *:VikiMarkInexistentInParagraph*
- VikiMarkInexistent, VikiMarkInexistentInParagraph
  Update the highlighting of links to inexistent files. VikiMarkInexistent 
  can take a range as argument.

- VikiQuote                                         *:VikiQuote*
  Mark selected text as a quoted simple viki name, i.e., enclose it in 
  [- and -].

- VikiEdit[!] NAME                                     *:VikiEdit*
  Edit the wiki page called NAME. If the NAME is '*', the |viki-homepage| will 
  be opened. This is a convenient way to edit any wiki page from vim's command 
  line. If you call :VikiEdit! (with bang), the homepage will be opened first, 
  so that the homepage's customizations (and not the current buffer's one) are 
  in effect. There are a few gotchas:

  1. Viki doesn't define a default directory for wiki pages. Thus a wiki page 
  will be looked for in the directory of the current buffer -- whatever this 
  is -- and the customizations of this buffer are in effect. You can 
  circumvent this problem by using |interviki| names or define a 
  |viki-homepage| and call :VikiEdit! with a bang.

  2. Viki relies on some buffer local variables to be set. As customizability 
  is one viki's main design goal (although, one might want to discuss whether 
  I overdid it), there are no global settings that would define what a valid 
  viki name is supposed to look like. As a consequence, if you disabled a 
  certain type of wiki name in the current buffer, you won't be able to edit a 
  wiki page of this type. E.g.: If the current buffer contains a LaTeX file, 
  |vikiFamily| is most likely set to "LaTeX" (see |viki-latex|). For the LaTeX 
  family, e.g., CamelCase and interwiki names are disabled. Consequently, you 
  can't do, e.g., ":VikiEdit IDEAS::WikiPage". Again, you can circumvent this 
  problem by defining a |viki-homepage| and call :VikiEdit! with a bang.

- VikiHome                                          *:VikiHome*
  Open the |viki-homepage|.

- VikiDefine NAME BASE ?SUFFIX                      *:VikiDefine*
    Define an interviki. See also |viki#Define()|.

                                                    *viki-functions*
Functions~

- VikiMinorMode(state)                              *VikiMinorMode()*

- VikiMode(family)                                  *VikiMode()*

- viki#MaybeFollowLink(oldmap, ignoreSyntax)         *viki#MaybeFollowLink()*
    oldmap: If there isn't a viki link under the cursor:
        ""       ... throw error 
        1        ... return \<c-cr>
     	whatever ... return whatever
    ignoreSyntax: If there isn't a viki syntax group under the cursor:
        0 ... no viki name found
        1 ... look if there is a viki name under cursor anyways

- viki#FindAnchor(anchor)                            *viki#FindAnchor()*

                                                    *b:vikiParent*
- viki#GoParent()                                    *viki#GoParent()* 
    If b:vikiParent is defined, open this viki name, otherwise use 
    |viki#GoBack()|.

- viki#GoBack()                                      *viki#GoBack()*
    Viki keeps record about the "source" files from where a viki page was 
    entered.  Calling this function jumps back to the "source" file (if only 
    one such back reference is known) or let's you select from a list of 
    "source" files. The information is stored in buffer variables -- i.e., it 
    gets lost after closing the buffer. Care was taken to reduce information 
    clutter, which is why the number of possible back references per "source" 
    file was limited to one.

- VikiOpenSpecialFile(filename)                     *VikiOpenSpecialFile()*
    Handles filenames that match |vikiSpecialFiles|.
    If g:vikiOpenFileWith_{SUFFIX} is defined, it contains a command 
    definition for opending files of this type. "%{FILE}" is replaced with the 
    file name ("%%" = "%") and the resulting string is executed. Example: >

        let g:vikiOpenFileWith_html = '!firefox %{FILE}'

<   The contents of variable g:vikiOpenFileWith_ANY will be used as fallback
    command. Under Windows, g:vikiOpenFileWith_ANY defaults to "silent !cmd /c 
    start".
    All suffixes are translated to lower case.

- VikiOpenSpecialProtocol(url)                      *VikiOpenSpecialProtocol()*
    Handles filenames that match |vikiSpecialProtocols|.
    If g:vikiOpenUrlWith_{PROTOCOL} is defined, it contains a command definition 
    for opending urls of this type. "%{URL}" is replaced with the url ("%%" = 
    "%") and the resulting string is executed. Example: >

        let g:vikiOpenUrlWith_mailto = '!thunderbird -compose %{URL}'

<   The contents of variable g:vikiOpenUrlWith_ANY will be used as fallback
    command. Under Windows, g:vikiOpenUrlWith_ANY defaults to "silent 
    !rundll32 url.dll ...".
    All protocol names are translated to lower case.

Variables~

Homepage:                                           *viki-homepage*
                                                    *g:vikiHomePage*
- g:vikiHomePage:
    An absolute filename that is the general viki homepage (see also 
    |:VikiEdit| and |:VikiHome|).

Simple Viki Names [2]:                              *viki-vars-simple-names*
                                                    *g:vikiLowerCharacters* 
                                                    *g:vikiUpperCharacters*
- g:vikiLowerCharacters, g:vikiUpperCharacters, b:vikiLowerCharacters, 
  b:vikiUpperCharacters
    These default to "a-z" and "A-Z" respectively; "international" users 
    should set these variables in their |vimrc| file to fit their needs

- b:vikiAnchorMarker

- b:vikiSimpleNameRx, b:vikiSimpleNameSimpleRx[1]
- b:vikiSimpleNameNameIdx, b:vikiSimpleNameDestIdx, b:vikiSimpleNameAnchorIdx

Extended Viki Names [2]:                            *viki-vars-ext-names*
- b:vikiExtendedNameRx, b:vikiExtendedNameSimpleRx[1]
- b:vikiExtendedNameNameIdx, b:vikiExtendedNameDestIdx, 
  b:vikiExtendedNameAnchorIdx

URLs [2]:                                           *viki-vars-urls*
- b:vikiUrlRx, b:vikiUrlSimpleRx[1]
- b:vikiUrlNameIdx, b:vikiUrlDestIdx, b:vikiUrlAnchorIdx

NOTE: [1] The same as *Rx variables but with less groups.
NOTE: [2] These variables are defined by |VikiSetupBuffer()|.

- b:vikiAnchorRx                                    *b:vikiAnchorRx*
    If this variable exists, the string "%{ANCHOR}" will be replaced with the 
    search text. The expression has to conform to the very nomagic |/\V| 
    syntax.

- g:vikiFreeMarker                                  *g:vikiFreeMarker*
    If true and an explicitly marked anchor isn't found, search for the anchor 
    text as such. This search will be case-insensitive. deplate won't be able 
    to deal with such pseudo-references, of course.


File handling:

- g:vikiSpecialFiles, b:vikiSpecialFiles            *vikiSpecialFiles*
    Default value: jpg\|gif\|bmp\|pdf\|dvi\|ps
    A list of extensions for files that should be opened with 
    |VikiOpenSpecialFile()|.

- g:vikiSpecialProtocols, b:vikiSpecialProtocols    *vikiSpecialProtocols*
    Default value: https\?\|ftps\?
    A list of protocolls that should be opened with 
    |VikiOpenSpecialProtocol()|.

- g:vikiUseParentSuffix                             *g:vikiUseParentSuffix*
    Default value: 0
    If true, always append the "parent" file's suffix to the destination file 
    name. I.e. if the current file is "ThisIdea.txt" the the viki name 
    "OtherIdea" will refer to the file "OtherIdea.txt".

- g:vikiNameSuffix b:vikiNameSuffix                 *vikiNameSuffix* *b:vikiNameSuffix*
    Default value: ""
    Append suffix to the destination file name.


Markup:

- g:vikiTextStyles, b:vikiTextStyles                *vikiTextStyles*
    Default: 2
    Defines the markup of |viki-textstyles| like emphasized or code.

- g:vikiCommentStart                                *g:vikiCommentStart*
    Default value: %
    Defines the prefix of comments when in "full" viki mode.

- b:vikiCommentStart                                *b:vikiCommentStart*
    In minor mode this variable is set to either:
        - b:commentStart
        - b:ECcommentOpen
        - matchstr(&commentstring, "^\\zs.*\\ze%s")
    In "full" viki mode it's set to |g:vikiCommentStart|.

- g:vikiTypewriterFont                              *g:vikiTypewriterFont*
    See |viki-textstyles|.

- g:vikiHeadingFont                                 *g:vikiHeadingFont*
    See |viki-headings|.

- g:vikiHyperLinkColor                              *g:vikiHyperLinkColor*
    Default: DarkBlue or LightBlue (depending on 'background')
    The color of hyperlinks, viki names etc.

- g:vikiInexistentColor                             *g:vikiInexistentColor*
    Default: Red
    The color of links to inexistent files.

- g:vikiFamily, b:vikiFamily                        *vikiFamily*
    By defining this variable, family specific functions will be called for:
        - viki#{b:vikiFamily}#SetupBuffer(state)
        - viki#{b:vikiFamily}#DefineMarkup(state)
        - viki#{b:vikiFamily}#DefineHighlighting(state)
        - viki#{b:vikiFamily}#CompleteSimpleNameDef(def)
        - viki#{b:vikiFamily}#CompleteExtendedNameDef(def)
        - viki#{b:vikiFamily}#FindAnchor(anchor)
    If one of these functions is undefined for a "viki family", then the
    default one is called.

    Apart from the default behaviour the following families are defined:
        - latex (see |viki-latex|)
        - anyword (see |viki-anyword|)


Etc:

- g:vikiMapMouse                                    *g:vikiMapMouse*
    See |viki-key-bindings|.

- b:vikiSplit, g:vikiSplit                          *vikiSplit*
    -1 ... open all links in a new windows
    -2 ... open all links in a new windows but split vertically
    Any positive number ... open always in this window

- b:vikiNameTypes, g:vikiNameTypes                  *vikiNameTypes*
    Default value: "csSeuixwf"
        s ... Simple viki name 
            c ... CamelCase 
            S ... simple, quoted viki name
            i ... |interviki|
            w ... Hyperwords
                f ... file-bases hyperwords
        e ... Extended viki name
        u ... URL
        x ... Directives (some commands, regions ...)
    Disable certain types of viki names globally or for a single buffer.
    (experimental, doesn't fully work yet)

- g:vikiSaveHistory                                 *g:vikiSaveHistory*
    Default value: 0
    If genutils.vim is installed, the history data will be saved in 
    |viminfo-file|. Like most of this plugin, this feature is _experimental_
    and is turned off by default.

- g:vikiExplorer                                    *g:vikiExplorer*
    Default: "Sexplore"
    If a viki name points to a directory, we use this command for viewing the 
    directory contents.

- g:vikiMarkInexistent                              *g:vikiMarkInexistent*
    Default: 1
    If non-zero, highligh links to existent or inexistent files in different 
    colours.

- b:vikiInverseFold                                 *b:vikiInverseFold*
    Default: 0 == OFF
    If set, the section headings' levels are folded in reversed order so that 
    |b:vikiMaxFoldLevel| corresponds to the top level and 1 to the lowest 
    level. This is useful when maintaining a file with a fixed structure where 
    the important things happen in subsections while the top sections change 
    little.

- b:vikiMaxFoldLevel                                *b:vikiMaxFoldLevel*
    Default: 5
    When using |b:vikiInverseFold|, a heading of level b:vikiMaxFoldLevel 
    corresponds to level 1, b:vikiMaxFoldLevel - 1 to level 2, 
    b:vikiMaxFoldLevel - 2 to level 3 ...  and a top heading to level 
    b:vikiMaxFoldLevel. I.e., if you set |foldlevel| to 1, you will see only 
    the text at level b:vikiMaxFoldLevel.

- g:vikiFoldBodyLevel, b:vikiFoldBodyLevel          *vikiFoldBodyLevel*
    Default: 4
    If set to 0, the "b" mode in |vikiFolds| will set the body level depending 
    on the headings used in the current buffer. Otherwise 
    g:vikiHeadingMaxLevel + 1 will be used.

- g:vikiFolds, b:vikiFolds                          *vikiFolds*
    Default: hl
    Define which elements should be folded:
        h :: Heading
        H :: Headings (but inverse folding)
        l :: Lists
        b :: The body has max heading level + 1. This is slightly faster 
          than the other version as vim never has to scan the text; but 
          the behaviour may vary depending on the sequence of headings if 
          |vikiFoldBodyLevel| is set to 0.
        s :: ???

- b:vikiNoSimpleNames                               *b:vikiNoSimpleNames*
    Default: 0
    If non-nil, simple viki names are disabled.

- b:vikiDisableType                                 *b:vikiDisableType*
    Disable certain viki name types (see |vikiNameTypes|).
    E.g., in order to disable CamelCase names only, set this variable to 'c'.

- g:vikiHide                                        *g:vikiHide*
    Default: ''
    If a dirty buffers gets hidden, vim usually complains. This can be 
    tiresome -- depending on your editing habits. When this variable is set to 
    "hide", vim won't complain. If you set it to "update", a viki buffer will 
    be automatically updated before editing a different file.  If you leave 
    this empty (""), the default behaviour is in effect. See also |hidden|.

Highlighting~

Viki.vim defines several new highlight groups. Precaution is taken to select 
different colours depending on the background, but colour schemes are ignored. 
The colors are tested using color scheme with a white background.

Files Region~

Viki knows a special #Files region.

Example: >
    #Files glob=lib/** types=f <<
    [[example1.rb]]     This is an example file
    [[example2.rb]]     This is another example

    #Files glob=*.txt types=f <<
    [[example.txt]] The manual

The filenames are stored as extended viki names. Each line can take a comment 
that is restored upon automatic update.

There are a few special commands to deal with this region.

                                                    *:VikiFilesUpdate*
:VikiFilesUpdate
    - Update the current #Files region under the cursor.

                                                    *:VikiFilesUpdateAll*
:VikiFilesUpdateAll
    - Update all #Files region in the current buffer.


If in the following commands a "!" is added, the command works only on files 
in the same directory or a subdirectory as the file on the current line.

                                                    *:VikiFilesExec*
:VikiFilesExec[!] FORMAT_STRING
    - |:execute| a vim command after doing some replacements with the command 
      string. For each formatted string the command is issued only once -- 
      i.e. you can work easily with the directories. If no special formatting 
      string is contained, the preformatted filename is appended to the command.
        %{FILE}  ... filename
        %{FFILE} ... preformatted filename (with '#%\ ' escaped)
        %{DIR}   ... file's directory

                                                    *:VikiFilesCmd*
:VikiFilesCmd[!] VIKI_COMMAND_NAME
    - |:execute| VikiCmd_{VIKI_COMMAND_NAME} FILENAME

                                                    *:VikiFilesCall*
:VikiFilesCall[!] FUNCTION_NAME
    - |:call| VikiCmd_{FUNCTION_NAME}(FILENAME)


Default Key Binding~
<LocalLeader>vu ... :VikiFilesUpdate
<LocalLeader>vU ... :VikiFilesUpdateAll
<LocalLeader>vx ... :VikiFilesExec
<LocalLeader>vX ... :VikiFilesExec!

Example: >
    Use ":VikiFilesExec! e" (<LocalLeader>vXe<cr>) to edit all the files in 
    the same directory or a subdirectory of the current file under the cursor.

                                                    *viki-compile*
Viki Compile~

The compile plugin simply defines |deplate| as the current file's |makeprg|. 
It also provides basic support for |deplate|'s error messages.

The compiler plugin provides a command for setting compiler options:

    - DeplateSetCompiler [FLAGS]

E.g. when using the lvimrc plugin, you could put something like this into the 
current directorie's .lvimrc-file for putting the output into a dedicated 
directory: >

    DeplateSetCompiler -d ../html


================================================================================
                                                    *viki-latex* *vikiLatex*
Viki LaTeX~

The archiv includes an experimental add-on for using LaTeX commands as simple 
wiki names. Among the commands that are to some degree used as hyperlinks or 
anchors:

    - \viki[anchor]{name}
 	- \input
 	- \include
 	- \usepackage
 	- \psfig
 	- \includegraphics
    - \bibliography
    - \label (as anchors)
    - \ref (in the current file only)

Limitations: There must not be spaces between between the leading backslash, 
the command name, and its arguments. A command must not span several lines.

Simple viki names (including |interviki|, CamelCase, and quoted viki names) 
are disabled -- as they wouldn't be of much use in a LaTeX document anyway. 
(Well, as a matter of fact they aren't disabled but LaTeX commands are defined 
as simple viki names.)

This plugin also highlights a hypothetical \viki[anchor]{name} command, which
could be defined as: \newcommand{\viki}[2][]{#2}

If b:vikiFamily is set to "latex", then calling |:VikiMinorMode| will use 
these commands instead of normal viki names. This change can be made permanent 
by adding this line to your |vimrc| file: >

    au FileType tex let b:vikiFamily="latex"
<
                                                    *:VikiMinorModeLaTeX*
LaTeX support is switched on with the command :VikiMinorModeLaTeX. This 
command sets b:vikiFamily to "latex" and calls |:VikiMinorMode|. This
command relies on the external kpsewhich tool, which has to be installed on
your computer.

                                                    *vikiLatex-UserCommands*
You can extend the list of supported commands by listing your commands in
g:vikiLaTeXUserCommands and by defining a corresponding function called 
VikiLaTeX_{YourCommand}(args, opts). VikiLaTeX assumes that a command looks 
like this: \latexcommand[opts]{args}. This function should return a string 
that defines the variable dest (=destination file) as well as, optionally, 
anchor and name -- see |:return| for an explanation of how this works. A 
simple minded example: >

    let g:vikiLaTeXUserCommands = 'other\|self'

    fun! VikiLaTeX_other(args, opts)
        return 'let dest="'.a:args.'.tex" | let anchor="'.a:opts.'"'
    endfun

    fun! VikiLaTeX_self(args, opts)
        return 'let dest="'.g:vikiSelfRef.'" | let anchor="'.a:opts.'"'
    endfun

                                                    *viki-anyword*
Viki Any Word~

If b:vikiFamily or g:vikiFamily is set to "anyword", then any word becomes a 
potential viki link.

This feature conflicts with the highlighting of links to inexistent files. 
Links to inexistent files are displayed as normal text.


================================================================================
                                                    *viki-bibtex*
Viki BibTeX~

The bibtex ftplugin defines record labels as anchors. Thus, if make an 
|interviki| definition point to your bib files you can refer to bib entries as 
viki names. Example: >

    call viki#Define('BIB', $HOME ."/local/share/texmf/bibtex/bib/tml", ".bib")

    Then, activating the following viki name
    BIB::[-monos-]#rec02
    would open the file monos.bib and search for the record rec02.


================================================================================
                                                    *viki-tags*
Ctags~

For ctags support (e.g. in conjunction with taglist) add this to your .ctags 
file (this assumes that *.txt files are in viki mode; you have to adjust the 
file suffix if you choose a different suffix): >

    --langdef=deplate
    --langmap=deplate:.txt
    --regex-deplate=/^(\*+ .+)/\1/s,structure/
    --regex-deplate=/^(#[a-z][a-z0-9]+)/\1/s,structure/
    --regex-deplate=/\[\[[^\]]+\]\[([^\]]+)\]\]/\1/r,reference/
    --regex-deplate=/\[\[([^\]]+)\]\]/\1/r,reference/
    --regex-deplate=/([A-Z][a-z]+([A-Z][a-z]+)+)/\1/r,reference/
    --regex-deplate=/([a-z]+:\/\/[A-Za-z0-9.:%?=&_~@\/|-]+)/\1/u,url/

For use with taglist, the variable "tlist_viki_settings" is already set for 
you.

                                                    *deplate*
Deplate~

deplate is a ruby script/library that converts viki markup to:

    - html
    - htmlslides
    - latex
    - docbook

Download the latest version from http://sourceforge.net/projects/deplate/.

deplate's markup is not 100% identical with the standard viki mode's one.  
E.g., it doesn't support underline, italic markup. deplate sometimes failes 
with cryptic error messages and it doesn't always give the results one would 
expect. On the other hand, it features inclusion of LaTeX snippets, footnotes, 
references, an autogenerated index etc.
