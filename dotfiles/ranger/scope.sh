# ranger, it will be left untouched. (You must update it yourself.)

# Meanings of exit codes:
# code | meaning    | action of ranger
# -----+------------+-------------------------------------------
# 0    | success    | success. display stdout as preview
# 1    | no preview | failure. display no preview at all
# 2    | plain text | display the plain content of the file
# 3    | fix width  | success. Don't reload when width changes
# 4    | fix height | success. Don't reload when height changes
# 5    | fix both   | success. Don't ever reload
# 6    | image      | success. display the image $cached points to as an image preview
# 7    | image      | success. display the file directly as an image
